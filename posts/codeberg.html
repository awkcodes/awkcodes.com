      <h1>Migrating personal projects to Codeberg</h1>
      <p class="meta">Posted on June 18, 2025 by <strong>Abdallah Khalaf</strong></p>

      <p>So i'm planning to migrate some of my personal projects that i usually work on in private repositories on github to codeberg, a privacy-focused alternative, 
      first for the privacy for sure and also because i have a nice handle in there ,"AWK", which i got in 2022  </p>

      <br/><p>
        now i have added 2 small projects to codeberg, MODO, which is the first program i wrote when i started learning programming , and NoteBad, a random web based text editor or something , in fact this is where i am writing this post from right now.
